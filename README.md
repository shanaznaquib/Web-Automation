# Web-Automation
Web scraping with Selenium and ProxyMesh, storingthedata in MongoDB, showing a list on a webpage. Thistaskwill test your ability to work with web automationtools, proxies, and data extraction techniques.
To write a Selenium script that fetches the top 5 trending topics under the "What's Happening" section from the Twitter homepage, you'll need to follow these steps:

Install necessary packages.
Set up the Selenium WebDriver.
Log into Twitter (if necessary).
Locate and fetch the trending topics.
Print the fetched topics.
Below is a complete Python script using Selenium to achieve this. Make sure you have the Chrome WebDriver installed and added to your PATH.

Prerequisites
You need to have Python installed, and you need to install the Selenium package. You can install Selenium using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install selenium
You'll also need the Chrome WebDriver which you can download from here and place it in your PATH.

Script
python
Copy code
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

# Set up the Chrome WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open Twitter homepage
driver.get("https://twitter.com/login")

# Allow time for the page to load completely
time.sleep(5)

# Log into Twitter - replace with your own username and password
username = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "session[username_or_email]")
password = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "session[password]")

username.send_keys("your_username")  # Replace with your username
password.send_keys("your_password")  # Replace with your password
password.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

# Allow time for the home page to load
time.sleep(5)

# Scroll to the "What's Happening" section
# This step might vary depending on how the page is structured at the time of running the script
# Sometimes, you might need to scroll or interact with the page to load the section
driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);")
time.sleep(2)

# Fetch the "What's Happening" section
trending_section = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//section[@aria-labelledby="accessible-list-0"]')

# Get the top 5 trending topics
trending_topics = trending_section.find_elements(By.XPATH, './/div[@aria-label="Timeline: Trending now"]/div')[:5]

# Print the fetched topics
for i, topic in enumerate(trending_topics, 1):
    print(f"Trending Topic {i}: {topic.text}")

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
Notes:
Login Step: Replace "your_username" and "your_password" with your actual Twitter credentials. This script assumes that Twitter prompts you for a username and password on the login page.
XPath: The XPath used to locate the "What's Happening" section and the trending topics might change over time as Twitter updates its website layout. You may need to inspect the elements and update the XPaths accordingly.
Timing: The time.sleep statements are used to wait for the page to load. You might need to adjust these times based on your internet speed and how long it takes for the page elements to load.
Make sure to use this script responsibly and in accordance with Twitter's terms of service. If you're running this script frequently, consider looking into Twitter's API for a more robust and reliable solution.

    # Allow time for the home page to load
    time.sleep(5)
    
    # Scroll to the "What's Happening" section
    driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);")
    time.sleep(2)
    
    # Fetch the "What's Happening" section
    trending_section = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//section[@aria-labelledby="accessible-list-0"]')
    
    # Get the top 5 trending topics
    trending_topics = trending_section.find_elements(By.XPATH, './/div[@aria-label="Timeline: Trending now"]/div')[:5]
    
    # Print the fetched topics
    for i, topic in enumerate(trending_topics, 1):
        print(f"Trending Topic {i}: {topic.text}")

finally:
    # Close the browser
    driver.quit()
Instructions:
Log in Step: Replace "your_username" and "your_password" with your actual Twitter credentials.
XPath: The XPath used to locate the "What's Happening" section and the trending topics might change over time as Twitter updates its website layout. You may need to inspect the elements and update the XPaths accordingly.
Timing: The time.sleep statements are used to wait for the page to load. Adjust these times based on your internet speed and the time it takes for the page elements to load.
Important Notes:
Responsible Usage: Use this script responsibly and in accordance with Twitter's terms of service. Avoid running the script too frequently to prevent being flagged for suspicious activity.
Updating XPaths: If the script stops working, it might be due to changes in Twitter's website structure. Use browser developer tools (right-click on the web page and select "Inspect") to find the correct XPaths.
By running this script, you should be able to log into Twitter, navigate to the "What's Happening" section, and fetch the top 5 trending topics.

Use ProxyMesh such that each new request to scrape the trending topics
is sent from a new IP address.
ChatGPT
To use ProxyMesh with Selenium to ensure each new request to scrape the trending topics is sent from a new IP address, you need to configure Selenium to use the ProxyMesh proxy server. ProxyMesh provides rotating proxies that can be used to avoid IP bans and distribute requests across multiple IP addresses.

First, you need to have access to ProxyMesh. You can sign up for their service if you don't already have an account. You will receive a proxy URL and credentials to use.

Prerequisites
ProxyMesh Account: Sign up and get your proxy URL and credentials.
Selenium: Install the Selenium package if you haven't already:
sh
Copy code
pip install selenium
Script
Here is an updated Python script to use ProxyMesh with Selenium:

python
Copy code
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
import time

# Replace with your ProxyMesh details
proxy_host = "your-proxymesh-host"
proxy_port = "31280"  # Default ProxyMesh port
proxy_user = "your-proxymesh-username"
proxy_pass = "your-proxymesh-password"

def get_driver_with_proxy():
    chrome_options = Options()
    chrome_options.add_argument(f"--proxy-server=http://{proxy_user}:{proxy_pass}@{proxy_host}:{proxy_port}")
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
    return driver

def fetch_trending_topics(driver):
    # Open Twitter login page
    driver.get("https://twitter.com/login")
    
    # Allow time for the login page to load
    time.sleep(3)
    
    # Log into Twitter - replace with your own username and password
    username = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "session[username_or_email]")
    password = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "session[password]")
    
    username.send_keys("your_username")  # Replace with your username
    password.send_keys("your_password")  # Replace with your password
    password.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)
    
    # Allow time for the home page to load
    time.sleep(5)
    
    # Scroll to the "What's Happening" section
    driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);")
    time.sleep(2)
    
    # Fetch the "What's Happening" section
    trending_section = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//section[@aria-labelledby="accessible-list-0"]')
    
    # Get the top 5 trending topics
    trending_topics = trending_section.find_elements(By.XPATH, './/div[@aria-label="Timeline: Trending now"]/div')[:5]
    
    # Print the fetched topics
    for i, topic in enumerate(trending_topics, 1):
        print(f"Trending Topic {i}: {topic.text}")

# Main script
for _ in range(5):  # Fetch trending topics 5 times, each with a new IP
    driver = get_driver_with_proxy()
    try:
        fetch_trending_topics(driver)
    finally:
        driver.quit()
Instructions:
ProxyMesh Credentials: Replace "your-proxymesh-host", "your-proxymesh-username", and "your-proxymesh-password" with your actual ProxyMesh credentials.
Twitter Login: Replace "your_username" and "your_password" with your actual Twitter credentials.
Fetching Loop: Adjust the range in for _ in range(5): to the number of times you want to fetch the trending topics with a new IP.
Notes:
Responsible Usage: Ensure that you comply with Twitter's terms of service and use ProxyMesh responsibly.
Adjust Timing: Depending on your network speed and ProxyMesh response times, you might need to adjust the time.sleep durations.
